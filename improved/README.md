# istio-buffering improved!

Through experimentation I have found 3 sets of settings that significantly improve (reduce) the amount of buffering that occurs with a slow client.

With the improved configuration settings in place, buffering is reduced from ~73MB down to ~12MB during the initial few seconds of the connection. It then rises slowly as data is drained towards the client. It should be noted that the buffer window seems to want to grow over time (after ~10 minutes the data buffered grows to 19MB). This suggests there is further tuning to do.

Manual testing indicates that having these settings do not meaningfully change the "fast client" situation. I tested from a client with a 500Mbps connection roughly ~180ms RTT away from the K8s cluster and it was able to achieve 18MB/s with the original (excessive buffering) repro setup, and with this improved setup.

Further testing is necessary as my test setup used a single node, so many of the inter-component paths are effectively near-zero latency local sockets.


## Improved settings

### 1. HTTP/2 window size tuning

Set:
- initial stream window size to 64k
- initial connection window size to 256k

This needs to be done in (at least) two places:
- the `connect_originate` clusters used by HBONE (see [istiod-values.yaml](istiod-values.yaml))
- `ztunnel` (see [ztunnel-values.yaml](ztunnel-values.yaml)).

The values of 64k and 256k feel like they make sense for us given our K8s cluster nodes are essentially on the same "LAN", i.e. high bandwidth, low latency. Whilst the initial window sizes are small, they will quickly grow as long as there is no backpressure.


### 2. `per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes`

This and the next item are both set via `envoyfilters.yaml`.

Set to 32k.

Note that although `per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes` is set in several places, we _haven't_ set it in these places:
- Gateway connect_originate cluster
- Gateway connect_originate listener
- Waypoint connect_originate cluster
- inbound-vip clusters

It seems likely that setting this on some or all of the above may further improve things but I have not had time to try.

### 3. TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT

Set to 16k.

We were able to set this on the Gateway, but it would not apply on a Waypoint.

When attempting to apply on a Waypoint, we get this error:
